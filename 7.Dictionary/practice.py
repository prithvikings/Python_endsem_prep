'''Write a program to change Dictionary keys into values and 
values into keys, and print the result as shown in the example.

Sample Input and Output:
data1: 1,2,3
data2: One,Two,Three
before exchange: [('1', 'One'), ('2', 'Two'), ('3', 'Three')]
after exchange: [('One', '1'), ('Three', '3'), ('Two', '2')]'''



'''Take an integer sequence from the user.
Write a program to print a dictionary 
from the given sequence, consider the element in the sequence as a key,
and the number of times the element 
occurs in the sequence as a value. Print the result as shown in the example.'''



'''Write a program to check the existence of keys in two dictionaries.
If the user key is existing in the first dictionary then print key present in first dictionary
and if key existing in the second dictionary then print key present in second dictionary
if key is existing in both the dictionaries then print key present in both dictionaries,
otherwise print key is not present in both the dictionaries'''
