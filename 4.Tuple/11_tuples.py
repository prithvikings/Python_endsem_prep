#Tuple
'''Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as a list
it is defined within parentheses () where items are seprated by 
commas.
Tuple is faster than list and tuple always include more than 1 value and we can not update value in 
tuple
tuple is a data structure which is also called collection of items
in which we can store anything like string,float,integer
In tupple duplicate value are allowed
We can Use Len to find length of tupple'''

t=(5,'program',1+3j)
print()
l=t.index('program')
print()
print(t,type(t))
print()
print(len(t))
print()
print(t[1],type(t))
print()
print(l)
print()
t1=(10)
print(t1,type(t1))#we can see here that its showing int becasue tuple must have more than one value
